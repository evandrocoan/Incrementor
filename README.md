# Sublime Text 2 Plugin: The Incrementor

A Sublime Text 2 Plugin that can generate a sequence of numbers using search and replace.

There is a Sublime Text 3 port available [here](https://github.com/born2c0de/Incrementor).

Example (Before):

    10. Bob
    12. Larse
    15. Billy

> Find: `[0-9]+\.`
> Replace: `\i.`

Example (After):

    1. Bob
    2. Larse
    3. Billy

You can also take start and step arguments `\i(start,step)` in parenthesis.

Example (Before):

    10. Bob
    12. Larse
    15. Billy

> Find: `[0-9]+\.`
> Replace: `\i(10,10).`

Example (After):

    10. Bob
    20. Larse
    30. Billy

Lastly, The Incrementor also supports negative steps! `\i(start,-step)`

Example (Before):

    10. Bob
    12. Larse
    15. Billy

> Find: `[0-9]+\.`
> Replace: `\i(100,-10).`

Example (After):

    100. Bob
    90. Larse
    80. Billy

## Using

Use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search for `Incrementor: Generate a sequence of numbers` to prompt for your find and replace.


## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
   Package Control Settings – User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   add the following setting to your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file, if it is not already there
   ```js
   [
       ...
       "channels":
       [
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
       ],
       ...
   ]
   ```
   * Note,
     the **`https://raw...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol...`**,
     otherwise you will not install this forked version of the package,
     but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol...`**

## Todo

- Replace based on order of selection as well as their direction. (Difficult)
- Scroll to matching pattern like sublime's default find window. (Easy)
- Allow prepending 0s to the initial number. (001, 002, 003, 004, etc.) (Intermediate)
- Add number of replaced items in statusbar after completion. (Intermediate)
